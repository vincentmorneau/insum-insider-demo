This is the Home Page of the Sample Database Application.  It is intended to be a sales dashboard of sorts - displaying some metrics which are derived in real-time from the database.

The <strong>My Quota</strong> region is a Flash chart type called  Dial Chart.  It is dynamically rendered based on a SQL Statement each time the page is viewed.  <strong>My Top Orders</strong> displays the top five orders for the currently signed in user, based on order total.  The <strong>Tasks</strong> region is an example of using a List to provide easy navigation to common tasks.
